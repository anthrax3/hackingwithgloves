# hackingwithgloves

This is a repository of ridiculous images used to depict hackers. For example, the lone hacker working tirelessly with sunglasses, hoodie, and mask ... all in a dark, ominous, room.

Each image must be sourced and (if it is reasonably small) added to this repo.

If the image is larger than 500k, please just add the source to the __sources.txt file so that this git repo doesn't explode.

## The Sources File

The sources file contains the links to where the images can be found. 

Each line contains a single link to a source. This makes automated scripts easier to parse and pull each image if needed.
